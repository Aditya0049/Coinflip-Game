# Coinflip-Game
This project is a simple coin flip game built on the [Blockchain Name] testnet. The game allows users to connect their crypto wallets, select a token amount to risk, and flip a virtual coin. If the coin lands on the side chosen by the user, they win double the tokens they risked. If it lands on the other side, they lose their tokens.

**Focus on Key Components**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Smart Contract:** Write a simple Solidity contract for the coin flip game.
**Frontend:** Use a basic React template to create the UI. Keep it minimal to save time.
**Wallet Integration:** Use MetaMask for Ethereum to connect to the Goerli testnet.
**Deployment:** Deploy the smart contract on Goerli using Hardhat. Deploy the frontend on Vercel.
