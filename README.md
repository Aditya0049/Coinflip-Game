# Coinflip-Game
This project is a simple coin flip game built on the [Blockchain Name] testnet. The game allows users to connect their crypto wallets, select a token amount to risk, and flip a virtual coin. If the coin lands on the side chosen by the user, they win double the tokens they risked. If it lands on the other side, they lose their tokens.

**Focus on Key Components**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Smart Contract:** Write a simple Solidity contract for the coin flip game.
**Frontend:** Use a basic React template to create the UI. Keep it minimal to save time.
**Wallet Integration:** Use MetaMask for Ethereum to connect to the Goerli testnet.
**Deployment:** Deploy the smart contract on Goerli using Hardhat. Deploy the frontend on Vercel.

**1. Root Directory**
The root directory of your project contains essential configuration files and the main directories for both backend (smart contracts) and frontend (web application).

hardhat.config.js: Configuration file for Hardhat, specifying the Solidity version, network configurations, and any required plugins.
package.json: Contains metadata about the project and its dependencies. Itâ€™s used for managing the project's Node.js packages.
package-lock.json: Automatically generated file that locks the versions of the dependencies installed.
.gitignore: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git (e.g., node_modules, .env, etc.).
**2. Contracts Directory (contracts/)**
This directory contains your Solidity smart contracts.

CoinFlip.sol: The smart contract that contains the logic for the coin flip game. This contract handles user bets, determines the outcome of the coin flip, and manages token transfers.
**3. Scripts Directory (scripts/)**
This directory contains scripts to automate tasks like deploying contracts to the blockchain.

deploy.js: A script that deploys your CoinFlip smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain (Sepolia testnet in this case).
**4. Frontend Directory (coinflip-frontend/)**
This directory is where your React-based frontend application resides. It contains the code for the user interface and logic for interacting with the Ethereum network and the smart contract.

public/:

index.html: The main HTML file that React will render the application into. This file includes the root div (<div id="root"></div>) where the React app is injected.
favicon.ico: The favicon for your web app.
manifest.json: Provides metadata for the app, including its name, icons, and theme color.
src/: The main directory for your React application source code.

App.js: The main component of the application that contains the logic for interacting with the smart contract and the UI for the coin flip game.
index.js: The entry point for the React application, responsible for rendering the App component into the DOM.
App.css: The CSS file that contains styles specific to the App component.
index.css: Global styles for the application.
components/: You might create this directory to hold reusable React components, like a button or a modal, used across your app.
utils/: You might create this directory to hold utility functions or configurations, such as connecting to Web3 or formatting data.
node_modules/: This directory contains all the Node.js packages installed as dependencies for the frontend application. It is typically ignored in version control (.gitignore).

**5. Miscellaneous Files**
.env: Environment variables file (if needed). You might store sensitive information like API keys or private keys here. This file should be included in your .gitignore file to avoid accidentally exposing sensitive data in version control.
README.md: A markdown file that contains information about your project, including how to set it up, run it, and any other relevant details. This is especially important when sharing the project on GitHub.
Summary of Workflow:
Contracts: You write the smart contract in the contracts/ directory and deploy it using scripts in the scripts/ directory.
Frontend: The frontend is developed in the coinflip-frontend/ directory, using React to create the UI and Web3 to interact with the smart contract.
Deployment: Once everything is ready, you deploy the smart contract to Sepolia and the frontend to Vercel.
Testing: Test the full workflow to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
This structure separates concerns (smart contracts vs. frontend) and keeps the project organized, making it easier to maintain and expand upon in the future.
