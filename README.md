# Coinflip-Game
This project is a simple coin flip game built on the [Blockchain Name] testnet. The game allows users to connect their crypto wallets, select a token amount to risk, and flip a virtual coin. If the coin lands on the side chosen by the user, they win double the tokens they risked. If it lands on the other side, they lose their tokens.
